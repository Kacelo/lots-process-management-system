# Project README

## Project Overview
This project is a task and process management application designed to streamline workflows by assigning tasks to users with specific roles, such as `admin`, `validator`, and `contributor`. The application utilizes Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and better developer experience.
- **MobX**: For state management.

### Backend:
- **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication and management.
- **Firestore**: For real-time NoSQL database storage.

### Miscellaneous:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Vite**: For fast builds and development server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- Firebase Project set up with:
  - Authentication enabled.
  - Firestore database configured.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase Configuration:**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore.
   - Generate a Firebase configuration file and replace the placeholder in the project’s `firebaseConfig.ts` file:
     ```typescript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     };
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Login/Sign Up:**
   - Admin, validator, and contributor roles are assigned based on user data stored in Firestore.

2. **Role-Based Navigation:**
   - The application dynamically renders navigation options based on the logged-in user's role.

3. **Task Management:**
   - Admins can create, assign, and update tasks.
   - Validators review tasks and update their statuses.
   - Contributors complete tasks assigned to them.
